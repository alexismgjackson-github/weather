# _WEATHER - REALTIME WEATHER APP_

Weather is a fully responsive app allows the user to search the realtime weather of multiple cities.

## FEATURES

- Real-time Weather App

## TECHNOLOGIES

- CSS
- React
- WeatherAPI
- Coolors Color Tool
- Google Fonts & Icons
- LocalStorage

## WHY I BUILT THIS

I wanted to do my own take of this common yet classic portfolio project!

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _USESTATE_

- Managing state to fetch weather data for the city entered by the user and handling errors

### _USEEFFECT_

- Peristing weather data in LocalStorage

### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, images, etc

## MOST CHALLENGING

- Displaying the icons based on the real-time data (using switch statement as a solution)

## BUGS

- I have not found any bugs yet

## FUTURE UPDATES

- Add Fahrenheit/Celsius toggle button
- Add Light/Dark mode toggle button
